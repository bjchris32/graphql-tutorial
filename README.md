# graphql-tutorial

This is project is based on the tutorial: https://www.howtographql.com/

## Take away
GraphQL is used as a middleware between the application and database layer to achieve the following goals
* avoid overfetching or underfetching data in frontend.
* separate frontend and backend work at the beginning when declaring the graphql schema.
* do not need to make extra efforts in maintaining responses in api endpoints whenever frontend requires more data fields already in backend.

## Future works
* Immplement frontend with react framework in the project
* Figure out how to use relay
